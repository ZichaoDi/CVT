\begin{itemize}
\item Referring to \cite{NA}, I implemented this barrier method on 1d-Linear control problem with bound constraints. So far, I didn't consider the ill conditioning of the Hessian yet, for the other part, just following the instructions on Matrix-Vector Products, Stopping criteria and the line search.
\item After the implementation works, I applied extrapolation to accelerate the convergence. Unexpectedly, it didn't improve the performance, but instead, the convergence is slowed a lot with extrapolation.
